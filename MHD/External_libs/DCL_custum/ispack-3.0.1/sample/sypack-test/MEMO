Outline
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   These sample programs are test programs for transform subroutines in
SYPACK. Use them to check whether the installation of ISPACK on your
system is successful or to check the efficiency of parallelization.

Contents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - test.f90: Test program for backward and forwad transforms in SYPACK.
              It also provides a speed check.
  - testv.f90: Test program for paired backward and forwad transforms 
              in SYPACK. It also provides a speed check.
  - test2.f90: Test program for backward and forwad transforms with 
               latitudinal and longitudinal derivatives in SYPACK.
  - testk.f90: Test program for multi-layer transforms in SYPACK.
              It also provides a speed check.
	      (You must set the number of MPI processes not to be
	       smaller than NDV, which is set in the program.)

If you did make ISPACK with setting either SSE=avx or SSE=fma, several
arrays must be 32byte aligned.  Similarly, when you set as SSE=avx512, 
several arrays must be 64byte aligned. In case your Fortran90 compiler
cannot do it automatically, memory allocation is done with MXPACK in
these programs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 After modifying macro definitions in Makefile appropriately in accordance 
with your system, do the following:

 % make (program name).out

Then you obtain an executable. When you want to run test.f90, do as
follows for example.

 % make test.out
 % mpirun -np 4 ./test.out 

Here, the MPI command, "mpirun -np 4", should be changed appropriately
in accordance with your system. Note that SYPACK also implements MPI-OpenMP
hybrid-parallelization. Hence, you can set the number of threads beforehand
as,

 % export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

Furthermore, if you are using ifort, you may have to enlarge the stack
size beforehand by typing "ulimit -s 1000000000", for expamle, depending
on your ifort version .
