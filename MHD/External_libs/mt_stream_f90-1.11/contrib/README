This directory contains contribution by Michael Briggs. 
He kindly wrote test codes in Fortran which compare the results from the 
original C version Mersenne Twister of Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto (2002/1/26), 
[http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/mt19937ar.c]
and those from the Multiple-Stream Mersenne Twister Fortran module. The tests will be
carried out in integer and real(8) cases.

HOW-TO COMPILE and TEST:
step 1.
  This directory does not contain the original C version code.
  You must first download the original code from the above URL and put it 
  in this directory.

step 2.
  Edit Makefile, and then type make command. Compilation and testing will start.
